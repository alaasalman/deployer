# Deployer

This repo is a place to share my deployment scripts with the world. It's quite dated at this point and comes from a time where deployment tools were either limited in functionality or over-complicated for my needs.

At the time, Fabric was a great tool and gave you a lot of control over the entire process so I ended up using it and writing my own deployment and admin functionality.

Note: Yes, I'm aware that there's a password in the configuration file. It's a throwaway password and only used as an example.
